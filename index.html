    <p>Welcome to my page! I'm a staff member working in the CS Department at TMU. I run the academic help centre, known as the Debug Room.
        The Debug Room provides services to students enrolled in first and second year CPS courses, helping students understand their lecture material and completing their lab assignments.
        The Debug Room also support upper year students with services such as: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Campus Resources</li>
        <li>Course Concerns</li>
        <li>Co-op/Career Guidance</li>
    </ul>


    <p>I graduated from McMaster's Mechatronics Engineering program, so I don't really have a formal CS education. To make up
        for any missing knowledge, I've been taking CS courses through the Chang School.</p>

    <p>Completed courses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>CCPS510 Database Systems</li>
        <li>CCPS530 Web System Development (in progress)</li>
    </ul>
